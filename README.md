The goal of this project was to create connect 4 in python in as little lines as possible (without using a semi colin). This project was originally assigned in my intro coding course taught by my teacher Mr. Yin. Ive slowly been making it smaller and smaller. The hardest part so far was getting the algorithm to check for a win as small as possible. I was able to get it down to one line using list comprehension.
